## Problem 2

**Overview:**

Create a list called $L$ and build a maximum heap $H$ with $k$ largest elements from $k$ sorted lists. In $n$-loop, extract maximum from the heap and save it to the array $L$, then add new element from the list where extracted maximum existed to the heap. Finally we get a sorted list $L$.

**Algorithm:**

Let $k$ sorted lists called $S$. We assert that the lists are arranged from small to large.

<pre class="pseudocode">
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sort}
\begin{algorithmic}

\FUNCTION{Sort}{$S$}
    \STATE Let $L$ be a new empty list, $H$ be a new empty heap
    \FOR{i = 1 \TO k}
        \STATE $H$.insert($S$[i].removeLast())
    \ENDFOR
    \FOR{i = 1 \TO n}
        \STATE x = $H$.extractMax()
        \STATE $L$.addToHead(x)
        \STATE Let $T$ be the original list of $x$
        \IF{$T$ is not empty}
            \STATE $H$.insert($T$.removeLast())
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \RETURN $L$
\ENDFUNCTION

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
</pre>

**Time Complexity:**

The first loop be executed $k$ times and each times be executed in time $O(\log k)$ of $H$.insert(). The total time of the first loop is $O(k\log k)$

The first loop be executed $n$ times and each times be executed in time $O(\log k)$ of $H$.extractMax() and $H$.insert(). The total time of the first loop is $O(n\log k)$

$T(n)=c_0+O(k\log k)+O(n\log k)=O(n\log k)$


## Problem 3

**(a)**

We assume for this problem that the input size $n$ is always a power of 2.

We prove that after the function `Unusual()` the array will be sorted. And the two subarrays $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ of input array $A[1...n]$ of `Unusual()` are both sorted.

**Basis:** When $n = 2$, the subarrays $A[1]$ and $A[2]$ are both sorted normally, and after swap operation, the new array $A'[1,2]$ are sorted.

**I.H:** The array $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted.

**I.S:**

Before the for-loop, we can know that the array $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted.

So we know that $A[1...n/4] \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...3n/4] \prec A[3n/4+1...n]$ (The sign $A \prec B$ mean that for any element $a$ in $A$, we have that $a$ is smaller than any element $b$ in $B$).

After the for-loop, which swap 2nd and 3rd quarters, we can know that the new subarray $A[1...n/4] \prec A[n/2+1...3n/4]$ and $A[n/4+1...n/2] \prec A[3n/4+1...n]$.

We rename the four parts as $A, B, C, D$, so that $A\prec C$ and $B\prec D$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])` and `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are sorted.

Now we prove that the current $A[1...n/4]$ are the smallest part of the four parts.

For any element $e\in A[1...n/4]$, for example, $e \in B$, so we can know that $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $e \prec D$.

Because $e \in A[1...n/4]$ and $e \in B$, so there at least an element $a \in A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $a \in A$. We know $A \prec C$, so $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2] \Rightarrow e \leqslant a \Rightarrow e \prec C$.

Finally, we can know that for any element $e$ in $A[1...n/4]$, we have that $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$, $e \prec C$, $e \prec D$. We prove that the current $A[1...n/4]$ are the smallest part of the four parts.

Similarly, we can prove that current $A[3n/4+1...n]$ are the largest part of the four parts.

For `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, because $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted, the $A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...3n/4]$ are both sorted. After the statement, we get the new sorted middle half array $A[n/4+1...3n/4]$.

So finally we can get the sorted array $A[1...n]$.

**(b)**

Let the input array be $A=\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Cruel(A[1...n/2])` and `Cruel(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

In the `Unusual(A[1...n])` call, before recursive `Unusual()`, without for-loop, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])` and `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, the array became $\left<3, 1, 4, 2\right>$, which was not sorted totally.

So the modified algorithm is not correct.

**(c)**

Let the input array be $A=\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Cruel(A[1...n/2])` and `Cruel(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

In the `Unusual(A[1...n])` call, after for-loop, the array became $\left<3, 1, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])`, the array was still $\left<1, 3, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, the array was still $\left<1, 3, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array became $\left<1, 3, 2, 4\right>$, which was not sorted totally.

So the modified algorithm is not correct.

**(d)**

**Unusual:** $\displaystyle T_1(n)=3T_1(\frac{n}{2})+\frac{n}{4}=O(n^{\log 3})$

**Cruel:** $\displaystyle T_2(n)=2T_2(\frac{n}{2})+T_1(n)$

Because $\displaystyle n^{\log 3} > 2\cdot (\frac{n}{2})^{\log 3}$, the sums of each layer is degressive.

Using master theorem we know:

So $T_{2}(n)=O(n^{\log 3})$


## Problem 4


## Problem 5



## Problem 6

**(a)**

Let the expected value of `OneInThree()` be $E_a$, the probability of `OneInThree()` returning 1 be $p_a$.

$\therefore \displaystyle E_a = \frac{1}{2}\times 0+\frac{1}{2}\times (1-E_a)$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_a=\frac{1}{3}$

$\because \displaystyle E_a=1\cdot p_a+0\cdot (1-p_a)=p_a$

$\therefore \displaystyle p_a=\frac{1}{3}$

**(b)**

Let the exact expected number of `OneInThree()` be $E_b$.

$\because \displaystyle E_b=\frac{1}{2}\times 1+(\frac{1}{2})^{2}\times 2+(\frac{1}{2})^{3}\times 3+\cdots=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k}\cdot k$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_b=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k}\cdot k=\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k}\cdot k=\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}\cdot (k+1)$

$\because \displaystyle \frac{1}{2}E_b=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}\cdot k$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_b-\frac{1}{2}E_b=\frac{1}{2}E_b=\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k}=1$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_b=2$

**(c)**

Let the expected value of `OneInTwo()` be $E_c$, the probability of `BiasedCoin()` returning 1 be $p$.

<pre class="pseudocode">
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{OneInTwo}
\begin{algorithmic}

\FUNCTION{OneInTwo}{}
    \STATE a = BiasedCoin()
    \STATE b = BiasedCoin()
    \IF{(a == 1 \AND b == 1) \OR (a == 0 \AND b == 0)}
        \RETURN OneInTwo()
    \ELSEIF{a == 1 \AND b == 0}
        \RETURN 1
    \ELSEIF{a == 0 \AND b == 1}
        \RETURN 0
    \ENDIF
\ENDFUNCTION

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
</pre>

$\because \displaystyle E_c=[p^{2}+(1-p)^{2}]E_c+p(1-p)\cdot 1+p(1-p)\cdot 0$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_c=\frac{1}{2}$

**(d)**

Let the exact expected number of `BiasedCoin()` be $E_d$, $p_d=p^{2}+(1-p)^{2}$.

$\because \displaystyle E_d=(1-p_d)\cdot 0+p_d(1-p_d)\cdot 2+p_d^{2}(1-p_d)\cdot 4+\cdots=2(1-p_d)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k}\cdot k$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_d=2(1-p_d)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k}\cdot k=2(1-p_d)[p_d+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}p_d^{k}\cdot k]=2(1-p_d)[p_d+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k+1}\cdot (k+1)]$

$\because \displaystyle p_dE_d=2(1-p_d)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k+1}\cdot k$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_d-p_dE_d=(1-p_d)E_d=2(1-p_d)[p_d+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k+1}]=2(1-p_d)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k}$

$\therefore \displaystyle E_d=2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_d^{k}=2\cdot \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{p_d(1-p_d^{n})}{1-p_d}=\frac{2p_d}{1-p_d}=\frac{- 2 p^{2} + 2 p - 1}{p \left(p - 1\right)}$


## Problem 7

Because $2^{19}=524288<1000000<2^{20}=1048576$, so the number contains 20 bits. So we need asks 20 times for all bits of the number. We assure that the first bit is the lowest bit.

<pre class="pseudocode">
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Query}
\begin{algorithmic}

\FUNCTION{Query}{}
    \STATE sum = 0
    \FOR{$i$ = 1 \TO 20}
        \IF{query the $i$-th bit == 1}
            \STATE sum = sum + $2^{i-1}$
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \RETURN sum
\ENDFUNCTION

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
</pre>

So the $T(n)=c_0+c_1\log n+c_2=\Theta(\log n)=20$ times

The the upper bound and lower bound are both $O(\log n)$ or 20 times.

It is obvious that the upper bound is correct.

Prove that the lower bound is correct, too:

Using the adversary argument.

Assure that we only ask $n-1=19$ times, like $?0000000000000000000$. Can we determine the number is zero or $10000000000000000000$ (binary number)?

If we guess the number is zero, the adversary Eve can say that the number is $2^{19}$.

If we guess the number is $2^{19}$, the adversary Eve can say that the number is zero.

And if we use other algorithm like dichotomy, it is also impossible to know the number less than $20$ times question.

So the lower bound is $O(\log n)$ or 20 times.
