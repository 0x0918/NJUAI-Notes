## Problem 2

**Overview:**

Create a list called $L$ and build a maximum heap $H$ with $k$ largest elements from $k$ sorted lists. In $n$-loop, extract maximum from the heap and save it to the array $L$, then add new element from the list where extracted maximum existed to the heap. Finally we get a sorted list $L$.

**Algorithm:**

Let $k$ sorted lists called $S$. We assert that the lists are arranged from small to large.

<pre class="pseudocode">
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sort}
\begin{algorithmic}

\FUNCTION{Sort}{$S$}
    \STATE Let $L$ be a new empty list, $H$ be a new empty heap
    \FOR{i = 1 \TO k}
        \STATE $H$.insert($S$[i].removeLast())
    \ENDFOR
    \FOR{i = 1 \TO n}
        \STATE x = $H$.extractMax()
        \STATE $L$.addToHead(x)
        \STATE Let $T$ be the original list of $x$
        \IF{$T$ is not empty}
            \STATE $H$.insert($T$.removeLast())
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \RETURN $L$
\ENDFUNCTION

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
</pre>

**Time Complexity:**

The first loop be executed $k$ times and each times be executed in time $O(\log k)$ of $H$.insert(). The total time of the first loop is $O(k\log k)$

The first loop be executed $n$ times and each times be executed in time $O(\log k)$ of $H$.extractMax() and $H$.insert(). The total time of the first loop is $O(n\log k)$

$T(n)=c_0+O(k\log k)+O(n\log k)=O(n\log k)$


## Problem 3

**(a)**

We assume for this problem that the input size $n$ is always a power of 2.

We prove that after the function `Unusual()` the array will be sorted. And the two subarrays $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ of input array $A[1...n]$ of `Unusual()` are both sorted.

**Basis:** When $n = 2$, the subarrays $A[1]$ and $A[2]$ are both sorted normally, and after swap operation, the new array $A'[1,2]$ are sorted.

**I.H:** The array $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted.

**I.S:**

Before the for-loop, we can know that the array $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted.

So we know that $A[1...n/4] \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...3n/4] \prec A[3n/4+1...n]$ (The sign $A \prec B$ mean that for any element $a$ in $A$, we have that $a$ is smaller than any element $b$ in $B$).

After the for-loop, which swap 2nd and 3rd quarters, we can know that the new subarray $A[1...n/4] \prec A[n/2+1...3n/4]$ and $A[n/4+1...n/2] \prec A[3n/4+1...n]$.

We rename the four parts as $A, B, C, D$, so that $A\prec C$ and $B\prec D$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])` and `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are sorted.

Now we prove that the current $A[1...n/4]$ are the smallest part of the four parts.

For any element $e\in A[1...n/4]$, for example, $e \in B$, so we can know that $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $e \prec D$.

Because $e \in A[1...n/4]$ and $e \in B$, so there at least an element $a \in A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $a \in A$. We know $A \prec C$, so $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2] \Rightarrow e \leqslant a \Rightarrow e \prec C$.

Finally, we can know that for any element $e$ in $A[1...n/4]$, we have that $e \prec A[n/4+1...n/2]$, $e \prec C$, $e \prec D$. We prove that the current $A[1...n/4]$ are the smallest part of the four parts.

Similarly, we can prove that current $A[3n/4+1...n]$ are the largest part of the four parts.

For `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, because $A[1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...n]$ are both sorted, the $A[n/4+1...n/2]$ and $A[n/2+1...3n/4]$ are both sorted. After the statement, we get the new sorted middle half array $A[n/4+1...3n/4]$.

So finally we can get the sorted array $A[1...n]$.

**(b)**

Let the input array be $A=\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Cruel(A[1...n/2])` and `Cruel(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

In the `Unusual(A[1...n])` call, before recursive `Unusual()`, without for-loop, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])` and `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, the array became $\left<3, 1, 4, 2\right>$, which was not sorted totally.

So the modified algorithm is not correct.

**(c)**

Let the input array be $A=\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

After `Cruel(A[1...n/2])` and `Cruel(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array was still $\left<3, 4, 1, 2\right>$.

In the `Unusual(A[1...n])` call, after for-loop, the array became $\left<3, 1, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[1...n/2])`, the array was still $\left<1, 3, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/4+1...3n/4])`, the array was still $\left<1, 3, 4, 2\right>$.

After `Unusual(A[n/2+1...n])`, the array became $\left<1, 3, 2, 4\right>$, which was not sorted totally.

So the modified algorithm is not correct.

**(d)**

**Unusual:** $\displaystyle T_1(n)=3T_1(\frac{n}{2})+\frac{n}{4}=O(n^{\log 3})$

**Cruel:** $\displaystyle T_2(n)=2T_2(\frac{n}{2})+T_1(n)$

Because $\displaystyle n^{\log 3} > 2\cdot (\frac{n}{2})^{\log 3}$, the sums of each layer is degressive.

Using master theorem we know:

So $T_{2}(n)=O(n^{\log 3})$
