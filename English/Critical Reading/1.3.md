### Why Are Domestic Films So Popular Today?

Recently, some domestic films got a very high box office, such as Hi, Mom, which reached 5.346 billion RMB. So why are domestic films so popular today? I think there are some possible reasons as follows.

To begin with, I think there are an very important reason that some domestic films have different and fancy scripts, which get rid of boring love story between lovers and change to new subject. For an instance, the script of the film The Wandering Earth is adapted from the science fiction The Wandering Earth written by Liu Cixin and the story describes the situation of that people escaped from the erupting sun and tried to find a new livable place with the earth planet. Compared with previous films, The Wandering Earth have a grander theme.

Furthermore, more and more directors of domestic films realize that it is not possible to gain high box office anymore through spend a large money in hiring popular idols, who are thought  to be able to attract their fans to contribute to higher box office before. Some directors of domestic film find that it is more important to spend money on script, special effects and characters instead of popular idols. For example, there are no popular idols in Wolf Warrior, but it still reach the highest box office in China when it come out.

There are still many possible reasons why domestic films are so popular today, like higher per capita income in China. But the phenomenon show that culture industry in China is becoming more are more mature.
