Hello everybody, I am 方盛俊. 

The title of my final project is Apple Inc. 1984 Television Commercial: False Individual Freedom in America Business World.

We all know that American people have the value of individual freedom. But what about big American companies? For example, how Apple company thinks about it. 

In my opinion, these big companies just take individual freedom as a excuse to make money. So I call it false individual in America business world.

Apple company publish a commercial called 1984. It is adapted from 1984, a dystopian fiction by the English novelist George Orwell. The story takes play in an imagined future, a powerful political party took control of the whole country. The Party commanded the Thought Police to keep watch on everyone’s individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the party was a dictator, enjoy the feeling of power. The heroine resist the dictator by breaking it into pieces with hammer. But actually Apple company publish this commercial just in order to promote their new computer Macintosh and laugh at their opponent IBM company. 

Apple company considers it as symbol of freedom.

But today, decades later, Apple company has become the company with the highest market value. Apple and its iPhone is very popular around the world. However, Apple’s App Store for iOS devices takes a 30 percent revenue sharing cut, which is called "Apple Tax" by many developers. 

To beat Apple back, Epic updated its game Fortnite with a new payment system, which enabled gamer purchased directly from Epic. Apple forbade Fortnite in App Store hours later, and Epic lawsuit Apple for antitrust immediately. Besides, Epic released a parody of apple “1984” commercial, called “Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite”. In this video, Apple became Big Brother, the one who control everyone. Epic company want to tell the public that Apple used to consider IBM as Big Brother, now Apple has become Big Brother too.

In fact, these big companies in America don’t care the true meaning of individual freedom, they just take individual freedom as a excuse to make a profit. Apple telecast the commercial “1984” just because the public believed that Apple is an innovator and challenger in front of IBM, and it can promote the selling of Macintosh, not really for individual freedom of the public. And then Epic opposed Apple just because Apple take too much revenue sharing cut from its game, not really for individual of the game players. 

Individual freedom is not always true in America, at least in America business world.
