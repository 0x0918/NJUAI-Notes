# Culture Hides from Us

There are many various types of culture around the world, and the hidden part is more important than the revealed part. But just like Edward T Hall said, it is more difficult for ourselves to recognize our own culture.

Why can't we understand our own culture effectively? I assert the biggest reason is that we settle in the circumstance for a long time and we are familiar with the hidden culture, resulting in we DO NOT regard it as special culture.

Chinese poet Sushi wrote a poem: The true face of Lushan is lost my sight, for it is right in this mountain that I reside. A Chinese is born in a harmonious environment and believes in collectivism, compared to an American who is born in a free country and believes in individualism. They both feel that their beliefs are accepted by all the world, so that they don't know the beliefs are their own culture.

I agree with Edward T Hall's opinion. The real job is not to understand foreign culture but to understand our own. If we research foreign cultures before understanding our own culture carefully, it is feasible that we will make quite a few mistakes in researching on foreign culture. Let us get careful comprehension of the culture hiding from us.
