# The secrets of coding

First, you should write down your idea appropriately. Without a good idea, you can not create a good project. A good idea is one of the most important parts in coding.

‌Then, try to build a prototype of your project. You should not want to complete the project within several days. And you also cannot complete one part before start another part, because the several parts are coupling. You should write their basic function such like a empty view at first. The combination of all the basic function is called prototype.

‌Moreover, improve the prototype step by step. You can add components to the prototype step by step. Do not try to add too many function at once. You should make sure they are executable and faultless. You can feel sense of fulfillment during the process.

‌Besides, you are supposed to test the program and fix the bugs you find and fix them. Bugs are the worst things when you code. In order to make users have better experience, you should test your program, find and fix as more bugs as possible before releasing your program.
