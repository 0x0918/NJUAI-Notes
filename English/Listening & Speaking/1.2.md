# 2.Dictation

Well, I woke up this morning and said to myself, "Now sara, what are you going to do with your life? What course are you going to do?"

My dad thinks I should become a financial adviser, and do people's accounts. Because I am pretty good with figures.

Or perhaps I should be some kind of biologist, because that was my best subject at school.

Or should I pursue my real love, modern dance.

And you chose modern dance.

Yes, I did. I want to make my living as a dancer.

Good for you! Now the course starts in the first week in September which is, let me see, the fifth.

Oh, great! I can't wait. 

Now, hold down. You have to be accepted onto the course first. You need to come in for audition and interview.

Oh, no. I hate auditions.

Hahhhh, I am afraid if you want to be a dancer, they are all part of the job.

Ah, well. When can they see me?

## Task 1

### What was the assignment?

The assignment was to write about Bruegel.

### Why did Watson give the student a C?

Because Watson thought Joan copyed Strass.

### How did Joan retort?

Joan referenced him as an expert.

### What was the solution?

Watson give Joan another chance, finding the stories and break them down into smaller pieces.

Do the both: go to a law school and get married.

## Task 2

You gave me a C.

I'm kind.

The assignment was to <u>write</u> <u>about</u> Bruegel. That's what I did.

No, what you did was <u>copying</u> Strass.

I was **referencing** him as an expert.

If I wanted to know what he thought, I'd buy his book.

Miss Watson, with all due respect...

Bruegel was a <u>storyteller</u>. Find the stories. <u>Break them down</u> into smaller pieces. You might actually enjoy it.

You're giving me another chance?

So it seems.

---

It is my file? What's it say.

Well, let's see.

Straight A's.

Until now.

President of the poetry society, captain of the debate team, co-captain of the tennis club, founder of the horiculture league.

I sound like a pompous ass.

Yes, you do, but a very busy one.

And it says you are a pre-law. What law school are you gonna go to?

I had'n think about that. After graduate, I'm getting married.

And then?

And then I'll be married?

You can do both.

Just for funny. If you can go to any law school at the country, which it would be?

Yale.

Yale. They keep five slots open for women, one unofficially for Wellesley girl.

But you haven't really thought about that.

## Task 3

# 4.Speech

## What do you think of students raising money for charity?

I think it is helpful for students to raise money for charity.

Not only can it help poor people live better, but also 

## Which one do you think is more important for girls, career or family/marriage?

Career and family both are important. You can't say any one in them is more important than the other one. 

The premise of having a good career is having a good family. 

If your family is terrible, it will influence your career badly. 

If your career is terrible, it will alse do harm to your family.

## How do you define "a good student"? (Is a straight-A student good student?)
