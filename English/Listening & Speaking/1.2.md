# 1.Speak

Complete.


# 2.Dictation

Well, I woke up this morning and said to myself, "Now sara, what are you going to do with your life? What course are you going to do?"

My dad thinks I should become a financial adviser, and do people's accounts. Because I am pretty good with figures.

Or perhaps I should be some kind of biologist, because that was my best subject at school.

Or should I pursue my real love, modern dance.

And you chose modern dance.

Yes, I did. I want to make my living as a dancer.

Good for you! Now the course starts in the first week in September which is, let me see, the fifth.

Oh, great! I can't wait. 

Now, hold down. You have to be accepted onto the course first. You need to come in for audition and interview.

Oh, no. I hate auditions.

Hahhhh, I am afraid if you want to be a dancer, they are all part of the job.

Ah, well. When can they see me?


# Listen

## Task 1

### What was the assignment?



### Why did Watson give the student a C?



### How did Joan retort?



### What was the solution?



### What did Watson advise Joan to do?

Do the both: go to a law school and get married.

## Task 2

You gave me a C.

I'm kind.

The assignment was to <u>write</u> <u>about</u> Bruegel. That's what I did.

No, what you did was <u>copying</u> Strass.

I was **referencing** him as an expert.

If I wanted to know what he thought, I'd buy his book.

Miss Watson, with all due respect...

Bruegel was a <u>storyteller</u>. Find the stories. <u>Break them down</u> into smaller pieces. You might actually enjoy it.

You're giving me another chance?

So it seems.

## Task 3

### What activities was Joan involved in according to her file?

## Task 4

### 1)

The student want to get married after her graduation.

### 2)

Do the both: go to a law school and get married.

### 3)

Yale.
