# 2.Dictation

Well, I woke up this morning and said to myself, "Now sara, what are you going to do with your life? What course are you going to do?"

My dad thinks I should become a financial adviser, and do people's accounts. Because I am pretty good with figures.

Or perhaps I should be some kind of biologist, because that was my best subject at school.

Or should I pursue my real love, modern dance.

And you chose modern dance.

Yes, I did. I want to make my living as a dancer.

Good for you! Now the course starts in the first week in September which is, let me see, the fifth.

Oh, great! I can't wait. 

Now, hold down. You have to be accepted onto the course first. You need to come in for audition and interview.

Oh, no. I hate auditions.

Hahhhh, I am afraid if you want to be a dancer, they are all part of the job.

Ah, well. When can they see me?
