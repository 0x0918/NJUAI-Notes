# Holidays: China and the US, the old and the new

My name is Fang Shengjun. My presentation topic is *Holidays: China and the US, the old and the new*. 

I will divide my presentation into three parts. First one is *Traditional festival in China*, Second one is *Origin of holidays in the US* and the last one is *"New" holidays in China and the US*.

## Traditional festival in China

China is a country with a long history and rich culture, so there are many traditional festivals in China. 

Most of holidays in China, like Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival can be dated back to a long time ago. And we can see, most of them are about family reunion, that is, Chinese traditional festival usually focus on, family.

For example, in Spring Festival, we want to (possibly have to) go home immediately, for family union. We go through Spring Festival travel rush, and get home finally. It is a great time, we can relax ourselves, after a whole year of exhaustion. But is not always great time, especially when I am asked to clean the house or visit relatives.

## Origin of holidays in the US

We have talked about traditional festivals in China, but how about the US?

The English word "holiday" is the combination of "holy" and "day", it means important religious days. So we can guess that many holidays in America derived from religious days.

In fact, many important holidays in America are relative to religious reasons. For example, Christmas Day is for commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ in the past. And Easter Day is for commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ in the past.

## "New" holidays in China and the US

Why I emphasize the word "in th past"? Because many people don't pay attention to the origin of the history of so many holidays recently, especially for young generation.

We can see, most of Americans celebrate Christmas Day not for religious reasons but for family union, festive atmosphere and custom like exchanging gifts. 

And in China, many young people prefer to celebrate western holidays rather than celebrate Chinese traditional festivals. But why? Is it that young generation in China don't like their own culture? My answer is not so.

Actually young generation in China is just like young generation in America: young people don't be accustomed to so many inconvenient out-dated customs. There are too many holidays about family, so that many young generation prefer some holidays for themselves and they can hang out with friends or stay alone quietly and do thing they want to do.

There are many truths about it. For example, young generation in China like traditional festival like Double Seventh Festival, which be called Chinese Valentine's Day. And most of young generation like holidays like National Day and Labour Day, just because there are almost no inconvenient customs in these holidays.

There are many "old" holidays in China and the US, but I think they will become "new" holidays gradually. We will see that.

Thanks.
