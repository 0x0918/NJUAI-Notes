## Chap 24: listen to part of a conversation at a university library. 

Hi, um, may I speak to the um archives librarian? 

I'm the archives librarian. What can I help you with?

Well, actually, I'm not a student here. I'm studying history at state (you across) town, but there's a collection. 

Oh, oh, wait. Are you the, um, sorry, I don't remember your name, but the librarian over there asked me about giving someone access to the jacobson collection. Is that you?

Yes, yes, that's right. Um, see, my paper is on the development of the coal mining industry here in the city. and the jacobson collection has a lot of information about john jacobson, like when he founded the company (in things), right?

Yes, it does more than you'll be able to fit into a paper i'd, but did your librarian explain what our system is here?

Well, a little she told me to make sure i bought my college id so i could get in the door.

Well yes, we'll need to take a copy of it too. even our own students who look at items from our archive collection have to leave a copy of their id with us. you also have to sign into the archives room whenever you enter and sign out, whenever you leave, there's a desk you know for security. 

Wow, so a lot of the stuff is valuable. 

Well, i don't know whether you get much money for it, but a lot of it is one of a kind. so if we were taken, that's it, it would be gone. 

I'll be careful. thank you. 

The other thing is the things in the jacobson collection are over a hundred years old, so i have to ask you wear our special gloves while handling the book. And also, i'm afraid you won't be able to photocopy anything.

No, i figured that i had a um i mean i can get everything i need a note cards, but suppose there's a page or two i really want a copy of. Can i, i don't know, take a picture or something?

I can't let you take a picture, but we have scans images of all the pages in the collection. you can buy a print of any page you want, but they're expensive. Five dollars a piece. So be sure, you know which pages you want before you ask for them. 

Oh, five dollars? why i guess, given how rare these things are ok. so you want a copy of my id, and then can you tell me how to get to the archives room so i can get started?

Well, why can't let you take a picture but we have scans images of all the pages in the collection, you can buy a print of any page you want, but they're expensive. Five dollars a piece. so be sure, you know which pages you want before you ask for them. 

Five dollars, why i guess, given how rare these things are. ok. 

> Emphasize that the book are rare, valuable and fragile.

### What did the student mean by this?

Why guess. given how rare these things are. 

> The print of the book is too expensive.


## Tyson

(Elizabeth Vargas:)

And finally tonight, Mike Tyson has earned 300 million dollars since becoming world heavyweight champion in 1986, but his outrageously lavish lifestyle forced him to declare bankruptcy just last week. ABC’s Robert Krulwich explains how the former champ squandered his fortune.

(Robert Krulwich:)

To spend 300 million dollars in 17 years, you’ve got to spend 48,348 bucks every day. How did he do that?

(Announcer:) Robin Givens and Mike Tyson!

(Robert Krulwich:)

Well, starting with the ladies, his first divorce, from Robin Givens, cost 10.5 million dollars. His second from Monica Turner cost another 6.5 million, plus she got a house. His houses were high maintenance. This one, for example, has 61 rooms; 18 bedrooms, 38 bathrooms, 7 kitchens, a disco, indoor racquetball, indoor pool, gym, private screening room and a master bedroom with 5 televisions. Lawn care alone at three of these homes, he says, cost 748,000 dollars. He liked pets --- unusual pets. He bought two Siberian tigers ---- these aren’t his, but they cost 70,000 bucks each and required a trainer. He liked cars. He had five of these Bentley convertibles at 320,000 dollars each. In the late 1980s, he bought 110 cars for himself and his friends. Then there’s Don King, the fight promoter who the now accuses of stealing tens of millions of his earnings. The two are suing each other, which means, of course, that Tyson has had to hire lawyers ---- lots of lawyers, 'cause he keeps getting into trouble.'

(Fight announcer:) What happened here?

(Robert Krulwich:)

For biting Evander Holyfield's ear, for being convicted of rape, for getting into fights at bars and hotels, for nonpayment of taxes, for filing bankruptcy, lawyers have cost Tyson millions. But is he embarrassed or regretful? A year ago anyway, he told ESPN, “Not at all.”

(Mike Tyson:)

I never dreamed of living this long. I never dreamed of fornicating with as many beautiful women as I did and having as much money as I did and having as beautiful and intelligent kids as I did. So if I was to die tomorrow. I’ve won… I’ve won.

(Robert Krulwich:) Even if the money is gone, he said then.

(Mike Tyson:) I’ve won.
