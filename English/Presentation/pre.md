### Prologue

Hello everyone. I am Fang Shengjun, an ordinary
student from Guangxi. Today I would like to talk with you a popular book.

Before the start, you can scan the QR code, and you will get the handout of my presentation. I'm worried that I can't express myself well, but I believe that you can know what I am saying with the handout.

Are you ready? Let us start the presentation.

### Outline

I have divided my presentation into three parts.

First of all, I will introduce you the basis of the book.

Secondly, I will tell you some interesting plots about the book.

Finally, I will talk about the influence of the book.

### Introduction

Look up this picture, what do you think about? Three stars move in chaotic trajectories. Yes, the book I want to introduce to you today is *The Three Body Problem*, a science fiction written by Liu Cixin.

I believe someone has already read the book, so let me do a survey. Again, scan the QR code, and answer the question: Have you read the science fiction *The Three Body Problem*?

Umm, we get some data. There are XX people who have read the book. We can't waste too much time on it, so let us go for next part: the interesting plots about the book.

### Plots

There are many great ideas in *The Three Body Problem*, but I am afraid that it is impossible to describe even one plot in such a short moment. I will try my best to tell you some interesting plots as more as possible.
