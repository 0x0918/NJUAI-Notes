Time to Protect Environment

There are different opinions among people as to environment protection. But it is already widely accepted that human activities have caused great destruction to the earth in many ways.

This phenomenon exists for a number of reasons. To begin with, it was obvious that human activities produce a lot of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which causes melting glaciers and rising sea levels. Secondly, many countries and districts are facing the problem of desertification because of the decreasing forests. Furthermore, the sewage we produced is going into the lakes and oceans so that many creatures be killed. Them are all caused by human's endless lust.

Obviously, if we don't control the problem, the chances are that destroyed environment will lead us in danger. Firstly, we can plant more trees and return green to the Nature. Secondly, it is also useful to establish laws and taxes to restrict the phenomenon of destroying environment. Last but not least, teaching the public the importance of environment protection and solve the problem at source. It is high time that we put an end to the trend. Let us take actions immediately.
