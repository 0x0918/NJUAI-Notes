Time to Protect Our Environment

There are various opinions among individuals as to environmental protection. But it is already widely accepted that human activities have contributed to great destruction to the earth in many ways.

This phenomenon exists for a number of reasons. To begin with, it was obvious that human activities produce a lot of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which results in melting glaciers and rising sea levels. Secondly, many countries and districts are confronting the problem of desertification because of the decreasing forests. Furthermore, the sewage we produced is going into the lakes and oceans so that many creatures be killed. They are all caused by human's endless lust.

Obviously, if we don't control the problem, the destroyed environment will lead us in danger. Firstly, we can plant more trees and return green to nature. Secondly, it is also useful for establishing laws and taxes to restrict the phenomenon of deteriorating environment. Last but not least, teaching the public the importance of environmental protection and cope with the problem at source. It is high time that we should put an end to the trend. Let us take action immediately.
