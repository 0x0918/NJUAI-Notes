Factors to success

Different individuals may have different ideas about success. Businessmen may think success is making a lot of money while writers may think success is many people read their books; athletes may think success is winning Olympic Games and getting gold medals while teachers may think success is having many great students.

No matter what we regard success is, it is all known that success comes from hard work. Taking Edison as an example, Edison failed thousands of times while he was working on inventing the electric light. He ended up being successful and finding the most appropriate material, Wolfram. Besides, before Darwin wrote down his famous book On the Origin of Species, Darwin search spent tens of years in searching materials to prove his theories.

Besides hard work, other factors may help us succeed in the future. If you are intelligent, it is more possible for you to succeed in the scientific research field. If you are strong and nimble, you have a better chance to succeed in the sport field.

So we can say that succeeding in a certain field is challenging and demanding. To take a step in the way to success, please be hard-working at first.
