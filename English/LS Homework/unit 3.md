There is more. Felina brushs and combs me twice a day. She takes me to the Pet Beauty Clinic once a week for a bath and shampoo. Really, cats can take care of themselves. Doesn't she know we have tongues that we use to look after ourselves and keep clean? And the flea powder she put on me, it smells awful. And I think it may give me my skin cancer. 

Felina thinks she know what kind of food I like. She doesn't even have a clue. She feeds me this gourmet cat food and she put it in a silver dish. Really, who cares? All I want is some day old fish that stinks and a little water. That is all. Is that asking too much?

One time, I managed to get out of the house. Did I have a good time. I ran around with some other cats in the neighbourhood. We ate garbage and chased the dog. I even killed a bird and ate it. Good fun. But when I return home, Felina went crazy. She was so angry. She took me right to Pet Beauty Clinic for a bath and shampoo. Even know I had just been there the day before. 

Once I had a relationship with a real sexy siamese down the street. But Felina stopped it. Emmm then Felina got me fixed. Now I can't be a father and have children. And I have lost all of my interests in female cats. To make matters even worse, she wants to have me buried next to her. I won't be free of her even I was dead.

What a life!
