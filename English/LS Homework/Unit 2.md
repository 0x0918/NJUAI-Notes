# 2.Speak & Memory

The ancient Yellow River flows uninterrupted from east to west for thousands of years. Silk was made into cloth while clay was made into pottery and ceramics. Millions of stones were piled into the Great Wall.

The country created many wonders, such as the Great Wall Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, Terracotta Warriors, and Chinese Kung Fu. Beijing is the capital of Zhongguo or China, which opens to and embraces the world. The Beijing Olympics Games 2008 and Shanghai World Expo 2010 were held here in Zhongguo. Peking Opera and Western Opera are performed on the same stage. Cultures of the whole world show brilliant vitality in this ancient country. 

This is Zhongguo. Hope you can understand her, appreciate her and love her. All the Chinese people black-eyed and yellow-skinned welcome you with open arms.
