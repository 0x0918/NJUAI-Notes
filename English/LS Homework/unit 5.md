But with the photos taken twenty-five or more years after the weddings, the judges were quite successful at deciding who was married to whom. They were particularly successful with the most happily married couples. Dr.Smith believes there are several reasons why couples grow alike. One have something to do with unconsciously mimicry. He says human beings imitate facial expression of people they admire. Another possible reason he said is the tendency for common experiences to mode the faces in similar way. If a couple do a lot of sadness for example, Dr.Smith said their faces are likely to alter in a similar way.

I choose the second topic, the Internet dating.

Compared with past years without the Internet, there are a lot of new ways to find the one that you love. Cyber love, which is born of the invention of the Internet, is accepted by people gradually.

The biggest advantage of cyber love is you can find one who has similar interests of you. I like to browse a video website called bilibili, where I find some upers get their true love from the website, because they have similar interests and be connected by the Internet.

In my opinion, true love can be found online. We can believe that true love can be found in school, working and introduction by parents and friend, so why not believe that the Internet is able to perform the same function? We live on a pluralistic society, we should also accept a pluralistic way to find true love.

That's all. Thanks.
