My favorite entertainment is watching videos uploaded by personal maker.

I watch videos in Bilibili and Youtube almost everyday.

Some of the video are very funny, and some of them are thought-provoking. I can learn many things from them. The videos reflect the interesting ideas of the makers. Them give me a chance to know other's world.

The influence it has had on my life is considerable. I learned skills from the videos uploaded by skillful makers. I got happiness from funny videos. I was encouraged by the videos made by warmhearted upers.

I think it is my favorite entertainment.
