Oral Homework: discussion topics

What do you think is the best means of communication and why? (e.g.texting; phone calls; emails; talking with each other face-to-face, etc.)

Some people think that the mobile phone is one of the greatest inventions in the world. It has made our life easier and more convenient. Other people think the mobile phone has brought about many problems.What's your point of view? And why do you think so?

Do you think people today communicate with each other more than before? Why or why not?

---

I think the best means of communication is Instant Message.

Compared to other means like calling and talking face-to-face, Instant Message have severals benefits.

Firstly, we can texting messages to our friends without worrying about disturbing others when I am out. It is very embarrassed for me to make a call in public. Secondly, it is more convenient for us to send a message to other one than e-mail, because e-mail is written formally. Thirdly, you can edit the text you want to send and recall the wrong message.

After all, I think Instant Message is the best means of communication.
