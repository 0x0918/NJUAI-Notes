Hello, is it Petty? It's me, Sue.

Yes, you are right. It's about my daughter Joy again.

Yes, she is still crazy about that Rock Group. She spent her money from her part-time job to go to all their concerts. She follow them all over the country. Can you imagine?

Joy is twenty-two you know. She should have a full-time job, live on alone and not get financial support from us. I just don't understand why she worship that Rock Group. To me, their music is nothing but noise. And their clothes beyond my understanding.

Well, thank you petty for listening to me. I feel a little better, Bye.

Hello, Mike? This is Joy.

Hi, yes, it is about my parents again.

They want me to have a full-time 34hn job and be on my own. I mean, I understand, but I can't stand their attitudes

They like show no respect for my value. Do you remember when I was really depressed once time, and almost killed myself. I was saved by the songs of the Rock Group Live. I think they are super and the power I receive with their concert. It give me the energy to live. They are my life. 

Of course, I understand what my parents are saying, but I wish they could understand what I'm saying. Without their lives, I could be taking drugs, I could be dead.

Well, thanks, Mike. You're like the only person who really understands me.

Yes, I will be seeing you.
