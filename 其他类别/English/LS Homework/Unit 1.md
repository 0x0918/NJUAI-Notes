# 0.The secrets of coding

First, you should write down your idea appropriately. Without a good idea, you can not create a good project. A good idea is one of the most important parts in coding.

‌Then, try to build a prototype of your project. You should not want to complete the project within several days. And you also cannot complete one part before start another part, because the several parts are coupling. You should write their basic function such like a empty view at first. The combination of all the basic function is called prototype.

‌Moreover, improve the prototype step by step. You can add components to the prototype step by step. Do not try to add too many function at once. You should make sure they are executable and faultless. You can feel sense of fulfillment during the process.

‌Besides, you are supposed to test the program and fix the bugs you find and fix them. Bugs are the worst things when you code. In order to make users have better experience, you should test your program, find and fix as more bugs as possible before releasing your program.

# 2.Dictation

Well, I woke up this morning and said to myself, "Now sara, what are you going to do with your life? What course are you going to do?"

My dad thinks I should become a financial adviser, and do people's accounts. Because I am pretty good with figures.
My dad thinks I should become a financial advisor, and do people's accounts. Because I am pretty good with figures.

Or perhaps I should be some kind of biologist, because that was my best subject at school.

Or should I pursue my real love, modern dance.

And you chose modern dance.

Yes, I did. I want to make my living as a dancer.

Good for you! Now the course starts in the first week in September which is, let me see, the fifth.

Oh, great! I can't wait. 

Now, hold down. You have to be accepted onto the course first. You need to come in for audition and interview.
Now, hold on. You have to be accepted onto the course first. You'll need to come in for an audition and interview.

Oh, no. I hate auditions.

Hahhhh, I am afraid if you want to be a dancer, they are all part of the job.

Ah, well. When can they see me?

The assignment was to write about Bruegel.

### Why did Watson give the student a C?

Because Watson thought Joan copyed Strass.

The assignment was to <u>write</u> <u>about</u> Bruegel. That's what I did.

No, what you did was <u>copying</u> Strass.

I was **referencing** him as an expert.

If I wanted to know what he thought, I'd buy his book.

Miss Watson, with all due respect...

Bruegel was a <u>storyteller</u>. Find the stories. <u>Break them down</u> into smaller pieces. You might actually enjoy it.

You're giving me another chance?

So it seems.

---

You can do both.

Just for funny. If you can go to any law school at the country, which it would be?

# 4.Speech

## What do you think of students raising money for charity?

I think it is helpful for students to raise money for charity.

Not only can it help poor people live better, but also it give students confidence and sense of responsibility.

During the process of raising money for charity, students have learned how to form a team and work together to attain a common goal.

They need to choose whom they should help, publicize their charity project to public and raise money from kind people.

They can get valuable experience from it, and it will also be beneficial to their job hunting.

The poor people who get their help can also live with better conditions. Goodwill will spread from one to another one.

I think, we students should try to do something like charity if we have spare time. It is win-win thing for us and others.

## Which one do you think is more important for girls, career or family/marriage?

Career and family both are important. You can't say any one in them is more important than the other one. 

The premise of having a good career is having a good family. 

If your family is terrible, it will influence your career badly. 

If your career is terrible, it will also do harm to your family.

## How do you define "a good student"? (Is a straight-A student good student?)
