## Question 1. Basic Understanding of KR and Ontologies

A logic-based ontology is specified in formal logic langugages, which are decidable and reasonable. With a domain of interest based on a fixed vocabulary, the knowledge can be represented by limited words and then be decided and reasoned in formal logic syntax. For example, we can use syllogism to reason more knowledge. If we intepret the domain and concepts as a set and elements in the set, we can compute the KR model with set theory in semantics. We can also interpret some logic words as set operations, such as union, intersection and subset, which are also computational.


## Question 2. Expressivity & Computability

**Sentence:** "What is your name?"

The sentence is a special question sentence, and it is unable to be modelled in the formal languages.

**My opinion:** It is a trade-off. If a logic-based KR language is designed as expressive as possible, it will loss some useful properties, such as completeness, soundness and decidability. For example, zeroth-order logic is decidable, but the first-order logic is undecidable. Natural language is as expressive as possible in any circumstances, but it is not a computational model. So I don't agree to the belief in the question.

**Sentence: The domain of the relation "citizenOf" consists of countries.**

- $\forall x(\exists y(\text{memberOf}(x, y)) \to \text{Country}(x))$


## Question 5. DL Semantics

**(1)**

**Question:** There is an ontology that has no model at all.

**Prove:**

Ontology: $\top \sqsubseteq \bot$

If the domain $\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}$ is not an empty set, there is no model that satisfies $\top \sqsubseteq \bot$ because $\Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \not \subseteq \empty$.

So there is an ontology that has no model at all.

**(2)**

**Question:** There is an ontology that has only finite models.

**Disprove:**

Assume that there is an ontology that has only finite models, and one of the models is $\mathcal{I}=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}, \cdot ^{\mathcal{I}})$.

Let $\{ x \} \subseteq \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}$, we can create a fresh element $x'$ and then replace the original $x$ with the new one $x'$. So the new model is $\mathcal{I}'=({\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}}', {\cdot ^{\mathcal{I}}}')$, in which ${\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}}'=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}/\{ x \})\cup \{ x' \}$ and so as ${\cdot ^{\mathcal{I}}}'$.

The process can be executed infinite times with infinite fresh elements so that the ontology has infinite models. So there is no ontology that has only finite models. 

**(3)**

**Question:** Every ontology has either no model or infnite many models.

**Prove:**

With the proof of (1) and disproof of (2), we can know that every ontology has either no model or infnite many models.

**(4)**

**Question:** A satisfiable class must always have a non-empty interpretation.

**Prove:**

By the definition of satisfiable class, a satisfiable class $C$ with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ exists a model $\mathcal{I}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ and some $d \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}$ with $d \in C^{\mathcal{I}}$.

Because model $\mathcal{I}$ is also an interpretation, so a satisfiable class must always have a non-empty interpretation.

**(5)**

**Question:** An unsatisfiable class may have a non-empty interpretation in some model.

**Disprove:**

If there is an unsatisfiable class have a non-empty interpretation in some model, it also satisfy the definition of satisfiable class, which is that a satisfiable class $C$ with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ exists a model $\mathcal{I}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ and some $d \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}$ with $d \in C^{\mathcal{I}}$.

So there is no unsatisfiable class having a non-empty interpretation in some model.

**(6)**

**Question:** An unsatisfiable class will be a subclass of any other class.

**Prove:**

With proof of (5), we can know that an unsatisfiable class is interpreted as an empty set, so the class will be a subclass of any other class.
