## Question 1. Basic Understanding of KR and Ontologies

A logic-based ontology is specified in formal logic langugages, which are decidable and reasonable. With a domain of interest based on a fixed vocabulary, the knowledge can be represented by limited words and then be decided and reasoned in formal logic syntax. For example, we can use syllogism to reason more knowledge. If we intepret the domain and concepts as a set and elements in the set, we can compute the KR model with set theory in semantics. We can also interpret some logic words as set operations, such as union, intersection and subset, which are also computational.


## Question 2. Expressivity & Computability

**Sentence:** "What is your name?"

The sentence is a special question sentence, and it is unable to be modelled in the formal languages.

**My opinion:** It is a trade-off. If a logic-based KR language is designed as expressive as possible, it will loss some useful properties, such as completeness, soundness and decidability. For example, zeroth-order logic is decidable, but the first-order logic is undecidable. Natural language is as expressive as possible in any circumstances, but it is not a computational model. So I don't agree to the belief in the question.
